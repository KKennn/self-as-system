    <h2>What I think about my data download</h2>
    <p class="reflection">Actually I had no specific ideas about what I would see in my Instagram data report, so I wasn’t expecting anything more than what I had already known such as the number of followers and followed accounts. To be honest, I was more surprised to see
        the most basic information appear in the data report like password changes and former email address because I thought this report might be related to something more deeply that could reflect my personalities and preferences. The only part indicating
        what I LIKE but not what I DID is Ads Interests. Among about sixty interests, I only found ten that describe me. I think the other 50 come from misunderstanding caused by accidental searches or clicks. What’s more, I think some of these interests
        are resulted from the accounts I follow. I follow some actors who also have a band and then Instagram would say I’m interested in many genres of music but I am actually not. It also states I have an interest in “luxury real estate” perhaps just
        because I was once apartment-hunting, and this is also not accurate. <br>There are images and videos that are sorted into folders by months, but I can’t remember whether I took/shared them through Instagram. For some of these images and videos,
        I thought, at lease according to my memory, I was using the phone camera instead of the Instagram camera, and they are still here in the Instagram data folders, which is a little scary. <br>As I went through the report, besides what’s provided,
        I noticed that the analysis of my social interaction was missed. The order of Stories, as I observe, is ranked by how close you are with the user posting the Story, so there should be a ranking of “closeness” with all of your friends. This algorithm
        might be based on the likes, comments, DMs and Story views between you and others.</p>
    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p class="description">This project, Self as System, is a “self-portrait” about my online presence on Instagram. The portraiture expression is based on the comprehension and manipulation of the user data downloaded from Instagram. The information I use from the downloaded
        data package includes direct message histories, comment entries, new connections with other Instagram users, contents I’ve seen, contents I’ve liked, and the ads interests of mine. These pieces of data are more representative of my personalities,
        preferences, and identities than others like the location, login histories, etc. The time frame of collected data ranges from 2018 to 2020, when this project was created. <br> Self as System consists of five individual sketches derived from different
        types of data, which come together as a whole non-linear, systems-based self-portrait of my online presence. <br> The first sketch is a list of color-coded Instagram Ads Interests. They are all generated by my online activities, but not all of
        them I agree with, or even am aware of. Those Ads Interests I agree I have are labelled green; those I find inaccurate red; those even I myself am not sure if I have yellow. This sketch leads me to a reflection of my personal agency in the digital
        world. Is it still my power to decide what I could, would, or should “like?” <br> The second sketch contains all emojis I have used to comment others' posts for the past few years in reverse chronological order. Interestingly, some clusters of
        the same emojis actually belong to different, consecutively made comments. I reckon it shows my state of mind/mood during a time period. <br> The third sketch is a bar of five vowels. The ratio of the area shows the frequency I have used each
        vowel for commenting others' posts for the past few years. This sketch might not only portray a personal language usage habit but a general linguistic phenomenon. <br> The fourth sketch is a selfie with adjustment of image threshold level, which
        makes it "binary" with only black and white pixels. Then I filled the black area with all the DMs sent by me. Among all the data, I believe the direct messages I send to my friends can best represent me. <br> The fifth sketch is a data visualization
        chart. The bubbles are a visualization of my Instagram activities in the past three years. The larger the bubble is the more activities there are. Both the variety of the level of activity in different years and in different forms are shown. </p>
